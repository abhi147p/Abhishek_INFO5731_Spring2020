0,"The entire movie looked like Video game art from Budokai Tenkaichi cut scenes. The art style was completely different than the original Dragon Ball Super series. It was incredibly disappointing and definitely ruined any enjoyment I had watching the movie.Gohans transformation was incredibly Anticlimactic and boring, and absolutely no back story, he just randomly transforms from being far weaker than he was in the Tournament of Power... Again, the animation of the characters was so off it looked like fan art from photoshop.Lastly is the creation of Cell Max. This was one of the worst parts of the movie, being that they claimed he was far superior to the original Cell. But he could not talk, he didn't heal automatically, or regenerate, and he was unrealistically large like a giant. No back story to how they improved him from the original (did they get cells from other aliens that visit the planet like Beerus, or Whis etc?) They should have definitely kept him closer to the original Perfect Cell but more powerful and intelligent and change his appearance slightly. Having Wings was pointless as pretty much everyone can fly with energy.. he could have powered up to fly away instead of using his wings..Great Plot though, had a good story too it. Just incredibly disappointing designs and lack of information."
1,"I'm not a Dragon Ball fan, the only times I've watched it was back in childhood, when DB and DBZ were streamed on TV. So it's needless to say, that I went into it clueless with some very old and general knowledge of the series, thinking it's gonna be a waste of my time. But to my surprise I genuinely enjoyed the movie. It was really fun and lighthearted story, that casual (in this series) like me, would like. I could understand why some fans of the series might hate it as it's just a filler and doesn't really feature main characters that much or add some depth to the story and so on. Does the story have some deeper meaning? No. Does it rely on Dragon Ball on Dragon Ball series' jokes? Yes. But it's the nostalgia and some Dragon Ball well known shticks, that made whole theater burst out laughing several times during the movie. This self-awarness and campiness is what really sold me on it (also Piccolo and his big titties being main protagonist(-s), honestly, I remember liking Piccolo as a kid and this movie brought back that fondness, but in a slightly different way). Didn't mind the 3d animation, just in faster paced action scenes did it bother me a bit with cgi being too visible (if that makes sense). The color palette for the movie was pretty too. Overall an enjoyable, fun and easy watch."
2,"I've seen the movie on cinema, and me laugh so much and like the humor on this movie! It's very well done! The graphics and cgi with a mix of 2D and 3D it's very very nice!This movie showed that they care about other characters besides goku and vegeta! I love they tell much more of the life of other characters and the new ones , I really love that they create new relations on some characters and other ones from past movies.I think it's a movie that is very good too watch with friends and family ! It's a time very well spent.It should be more specific in some things about the story behind and explain better some terms at the end. But in resume and liked very much the movie."
3,"To be honest, at first I was really concerned about the CGI-Animation. Since DBS Broly looked so great with the shintani art style, It was really sad to hear this movie would not get the same treatment.After I saw the movie, I have to say: This is a really great Dragon Ball Movie and I am very happy with it. The animations are really good, the CGI looks really great. The story- althought not being the greatest- made sense and was different. Even though Goku and Vegeta did not play an important role in the movie, It was really fun to see Piccolo and Gohan in the main character role. The fights were amazing, and the movie had a great climax with Beast Gohan beating Cell Max. The only negative point would be the short period of time we saw Beast Gohan. But at the end of the day, It is a movie so the amount of time it has is limited.Overall a great movie."
4,"As A Dragon Ball Fan From India It Was Delight To Watch It In Theatre After So Many Years And As Toriyama's Statements That Gohan Can Be Powerful If He Wanted To, This Time We Saw It. Goku & Vegeta Don't Get Much Time In This Movie It's Properly Based On Piccolo & Gohan. Plot Of Movie Is 100% Dragon Ball Style Action Filled With Situational Comedy But As Run Time Is Less Movie Lacks In Properly Setting The Plot. Also The Animation Style That Dragon Ball Used Is Pretty Unique This Time And It Should Be Given A Chance Watching Such New Animation Style In Theatres Worked For Me But It Varies For Everyone. Overall You Should Watch It For Sure Cause Dragon Ball Has The Best Transformations In Anime And Watching Those Transformations In Theatres Is An Awesome Experience."
5,Horrible storyline with even worse transformation. Nothing is original. They basically gave baby vegeta's look to gohan and turned cell into bio broly.
6,"This is one of the few dragon ball movies that actually have story to follow and not just 10 minutes of text+ 1 hour of punches (which is what most of the people want anyway). It has great visuals even tho i was skeptical because of the cgi, i was gladly wrong.It makes sense that they could have been able to recreate Cell, since RRA were the only ones with the data from Dr Gero and his projects.Also love the fact that we can see how things developt when there's no Goku or Vegeta around to save the day.It has a good amount of fan service (Gohan Blanco), a new form for a fan favorite character (Piccolo), and the enemys have a motivation, (not like you, 90's Broly). Overall a great Dragon Ball movie, probably a top 5."
7,First of all the story is really just a mix of android/cell saga and bio broly movie. Which would have been ok as DB movies never have stories imho. Its more about the villain and cool action.And this is where the problems begin. That cell Monster? Idk I think it sucked. Piccolo is really the mvp of this movie. Spy action. Clever moves. Wishes from shenron. Tacniques he didnt use since classic DB. Its all there and I loved it. His new form im a little torn. I think the fact he finally gets simething is awesome. Well deserved screentime here.Gohan tho? Honestly the movie could have been a 8 or 9 for me if gohan was just completely not in it. Its so annoying he just transforms into something not even very special in the end and blasts the big bad dead. With piccolos move that he never used before. Stupid. Devalued piccolos power up big time and really destroyed the whole movie. At least for me.

9,"A great addition to Super if you're a casual DBZ/S fan, and a must-watch if you're a Piccolo or Gohan fan! Man, did it feel refreshing to see them take the spotlight! Its issues mostly lie with pacing and way too much Red Ribbon backstory clogging up the run time, the worst offender being Toei missing a perfect opportunity to reprise Great Saiyaman, ESPECIALLY when ""superhero"" is its namesake!The comedy was on-point and had me laughing at every other line! Pan was adorable and the Gammas were love at first sight; they stole the second act and had the best fight in the movie. The CG is well-done and and really takes advantage of the cinematography and fighting choreography. I wouldn't put it in my Top 5 DBZ/S movies, but it has a place in my Top 10 for a DBZ/S marathon."
10,Been a loyal fan of the dragon ball franchise for 25+ years and this film really reinforced what my feelings have been for the last couple years.I enjoyed the Latest Broly film and there was some good parts of dragon ball super but on the whole they have ruined the franchise through making it seems like the audience they are aiming for are very young children? If you compare this latest film with dragon ball Z it really is sad to see how much it has regressed. I was sat in the cinema and it was actually to the point where it was painful it was that bad! No wonder fan made dragon ball anime on YT is getting removed when it is so much better than the rubbish they seem to be producing now!The transformations in this particular film make absolute no sense and the animation imo is shockingly bad. This was the GOAT programme but now the likes of demon slayer and AOT is leaving dragon ball for dust!I cannot understand how people who are life long dragon ball fans can rate this film so highly? I never write reviews but I was that disappointed I felt I had to!
11,"This movie was very bad, Dragon ball characters have always been characterized by showing their personality, in this movie the villain doesn't even say a word, he has no personality.Some people who have always been in the story lose their essence, for example Bulma leaves aside the technology for aesthetic things, as well as Pikoro and his change of attitude and tolerance towards the villain.For the creation of a Cell Max should have given more details of its operation, origin, reason for creation and also seems a little out of the story, as Trunks and Crilin finish with the laboratory and destroy everything related to the creation of cell, only take the plans of Android 17 and 18, so it was almost impossible to get all that information.I didn't like it, it's a movie made for 6-9 year old kids who don't need to know the story and laugh at simple jokes."
12,"Like honestly, Akira, you are ruining your legacy. This had so much potential, what is this. Piccolo's big transformation is called Orange piccolo. Like come on man and it's just a worse cell saga. The only reason goku and vegeta were in the movie even for a little while is cuz they're the face of dragon ball super. But they took cell's design and took everything that made him good away from him, and then they had the gall to say that they used Dr. Gero's documents for it. COME ON, HE WASN'T EVEN IN PERFECT FORM. And another thing that made cell great that they took from Cell max is his intelligence. Cell max was said to be complete in the movie he was just beserk the entire time."
13,As title states. Highly disappointed in this and I've tried every single outlet short of Disney plus. If anybody has the link and is capable of sharing it with me that would be great. I just want to watch the movie but I like in Canada and that apparently makes me ineligible to watch the movie. It makes zero sense also that I have to write 600 words just to make this complaint. North America needs to regulate its viewing licenses better and have a proper control over who may and who may not view or purchase content. 1/10 and that's going to stay that way. How absurd is it that this far passed release I still can't watch it in Canada.
14,"This movie is a breathe of fresh air. High stakes, world ending drama that only the master Akira Toriyama can produce. It is a beautifully written & gorgeously animated story that puts Gohan & Piccolo as its centerpieces. Instead of a typical Dragon Ball storyline where the staples of the franchise(Goku & Vegeta) step in and save the day because only they are strong enough to defeat the villain. This movie focuses more on past supporting characters and allows them to shine as the heros. And shine they did! It's wonderful to see Gohan finally gets to show his true potential & power on screen and not just have it be talked about as a potential in the future. They dangled that carrot long enough. Pan's character arc made great strides in this film. It wasn't a lot, but it also wasn't over the top or overbearing. I'm very excited to see how her story progresses under the teachings of Piccolo(like father, like daughter). Trunks and Goten finally becoming teenagers is long over due and was something I was very happy to see. And the newest edition to the franchise, 'Gamma 2.' Gamma 2 is an awesome edition to the Dragon Ball roster. His personality, fighting style & abilities are not overly OP for an android. Hollywood could take a few notes from this movie on how to introduce a new character in a long storied & successful franchise(seriously).This is a fantastic movie. However it is not perfect. It does have its imperfections within the script, but I would like to preface, my gripes are very minimal & I don't think had these changes been implimented. It would not have improved upon the movie very much. The trailers from last summer felt misleading after watching. I'm very pleased with where this movie went and the areas it explored for the Gohan fandom that has been asking for this for 30+ years. However, I wish it could have been a tad more upfront about this instead of using Goku and Vegeta as its main selling point during the marketing campaign for its release. It's great that Gohan finally was able to break through his ceiling and being pushed beyond his limits. What lost me a bit was he shouldn't have been able to do so, given his lack of continuous training. Piccolo made a strong point of emphasis about this early in the film. He was only able to do so because of the hollywood Vin Diesel syndrome. ""Family."" The fact this franchise was built on the backs of Goku & Vegeta, it would have been nice to see them get more than 15 minutes of screen time throughout its runtime. It would have been nice to see what progress they both made in their training with Whis since their fight with Broly. With that being said, I'd like to reiterate that these are very minor gripes, and changing these things would not really improve upon the story.To sumerize, this was a fantastic story that introduced new characters and expanded upon several of the franchises' most beloved characters. I'm very excited to see how Toriyama implements Pan & Gamma 2, the ever expanding universe of Dragon Ball Super."

It has great visuals even tho i was skeptical because of the cgi, i was gladly wrong.It makes sense that they could have been able to recreate Cell, since RRA were the only ones with the data from Dr Gero and his projects.Also love the fact that we can see how things developt when there's no Goku or Vegeta around to save the day.It has a good amount of fan service (Gohan Blanco), a new form for a fan favorite character (Piccolo), and the enemys have a motivation, (not like you, 90's Broly). Overall a great Dragon Ball movie, probably a top 5."
37,First of all the story is really just a mix of android/cell saga and bio broly movie. Which would have been ok as DB movies never have stories imho. Its more about the villain and cool action.And this is where the problems begin. That cell Monster? Idk I think it sucked. Piccolo is really the mvp of this movie. Spy action. Clever moves. Wishes from shenron. Tacniques he didnt use since classic DB. Its all there and I loved it. His new form im a little torn. I think the fact he finally gets simething is awesome. Well deserved screentime here.Gohan tho? Honestly the movie could have been a 8 or 9 for me if gohan was just completely not in it. Its so annoying he just transforms into something not even very special in the end and blasts the big bad dead. With piccolos move that he never used before. Stupid. Devalued piccolos power up big time and really destroyed the whole movie. At least for me.

39,"A great addition to Super if you're a casual DBZ/S fan, and a must-watch if you're a Piccolo or Gohan fan! Man, did it feel refreshing to see them take the spotlight! Its issues mostly lie with pacing and way too much Red Ribbon backstory clogging up the run time, the worst offender being Toei missing a perfect opportunity to reprise Great Saiyaman, ESPECIALLY when ""superhero"" is its namesake!The comedy was on-point and had me laughing at every other line! Pan was adorable and the Gammas were love at first sight; they stole the second act and had the best fight in the movie. The CG is well-done and and really takes advantage of the cinematography and fighting choreography. I wouldn't put it in my Top 5 DBZ/S movies, but it has a place in my Top 10 for a DBZ/S marathon."
40,Been a loyal fan of the dragon ball franchise for 25+ years and this film really reinforced what my feelings have been for the last couple years.I enjoyed the Latest Broly film and there was some good parts of dragon ball super but on the whole they have ruined the franchise through making it seems like the audience they are aiming for are very young children? If you compare this latest film with dragon ball Z it really is sad to see how much it has regressed. I was sat in the cinema and it was actually to the point where it was painful it was that bad! No wonder fan made dragon ball anime on YT is getting removed when it is so much better than the rubbish they seem to be producing now!The transformations in this particular film make absolute no sense and the animation imo is shockingly bad. This was the GOAT programme but now the likes of demon slayer and AOT is leaving dragon ball for dust!I cannot understand how people who are life long dragon ball fans can rate this film so highly? I never write reviews but I was that disappointed I felt I had to!
41,"This movie was very bad, Dragon ball characters have always been characterized by showing their personality, in this movie the villain doesn't even say a word, he has no personality.Some people who have always been in the story lose their essence, for example Bulma leaves aside the technology for aesthetic things, as well as Pikoro and his change of attitude and tolerance towards the villain.For the creation of a Cell Max should have given more details of its operation, origin, reason for creation and also seems a little out of the story, as Trunks and Crilin finish with the laboratory and destroy everything related to the creation of cell, only take the plans of Android 17 and 18, so it was almost impossible to get all that information.I didn't like it, it's a movie made for 6-9 year old kids who don't need to know the story and laugh at simple jokes."
42,"Like honestly, Akira, you are ruining your legacy. This had so much potential, what is this. Piccolo's big transformation is called Orange piccolo. Like come on man and it's just a worse cell saga. The only reason goku and vegeta were in the movie even for a little while is cuz they're the face of dragon ball super. But they took cell's design and took everything that made him good away from him, and then they had the gall to say that they used Dr. Gero's documents for it. COME ON, HE WASN'T EVEN IN PERFECT FORM. And another thing that made cell great that they took from Cell max is his intelligence. Cell max was said to be complete in the movie he was just beserk the entire time."
43,As title states. Highly disappointed in this and I've tried every single outlet short of Disney plus. If anybody has the link and is capable of sharing it with me that would be great. I just want to watch the movie but I like in Canada and that apparently makes me ineligible to watch the movie. It makes zero sense also that I have to write 600 words just to make this complaint. North America needs to regulate its viewing licenses better and have a proper control over who may and who may not view or purchase content. 1/10 and that's going to stay that way. How absurd is it that this far passed release I still can't watch it in Canada.
44,"This movie is a breathe of fresh air. High stakes, world ending drama that only the master Akira Toriyama can produce. It is a beautifully written & gorgeously animated story that puts Gohan & Piccolo as its centerpieces. Instead of a typical Dragon Ball storyline where the staples of the franchise(Goku & Vegeta) step in and save the day because only they are strong enough to defeat the villain. This movie focuses more on past supporting characters and allows them to shine as the heros. And shine they did! It's wonderful to see Gohan finally gets to show his true potential & power on screen and not just have it be talked about as a potential in the future. They dangled that carrot long enough. Pan's character arc made great strides in this film. It wasn't a lot, but it also wasn't over the top or overbearing. I'm very excited to see how her story progresses under the teachings of Piccolo(like father, like daughter). Trunks and Goten finally becoming teenagers is long over due and was something I was very happy to see. And the newest edition to the franchise, 'Gamma 2.' Gamma 2 is an awesome edition to the Dragon Ball roster. His personality, fighting style & abilities are not overly OP for an android. Hollywood could take a few notes from this movie on how to introduce a new character in a long storied & successful franchise(seriously).This is a fantastic movie. However it is not perfect. It does have its imperfections within the script, but I would like to preface, my gripes are very minimal & I don't think had these changes been implimented. It would not have improved upon the movie very much. The trailers from last summer felt misleading after watching. I'm very pleased with where this movie went and the areas it explored for the Gohan fandom that has been asking for this for 30+ years. However, I wish it could have been a tad more upfront about this instead of using Goku and Vegeta as its main selling point during the marketing campaign for its release. It's great that Gohan finally was able to break through his ceiling and being pushed beyond his limits. What lost me a bit was he shouldn't have been able to do so, given his lack of continuous training. Piccolo made a strong point of emphasis about this early in the film. He was only able to do so because of the hollywood Vin Diesel syndrome. ""Family."" The fact this franchise was built on the backs of Goku & Vegeta, it would have been nice to see them get more than 15 minutes of screen time throughout its runtime. It would have been nice to see what progress they both made in their training with Whis since their fight with Broly. With that being said, I'd like to reiterate that these are very minor gripes, and changing these things would not really improve upon the story.To sumerize, this was a fantastic story that introduced new characters and expanded upon several of the franchises' most beloved characters. I'm very excited to see how Toriyama implements Pan & Gamma 2, the ever expanding universe of Dragon Ball Super."
45,"The entire movie looked like Video game art from Budokai Tenkaichi cut scenes. The art style was completely different than the original Dragon Ball Super series. It was incredibly disappointing and definitely ruined any enjoyment I had watching the movie.Gohans transformation was incredibly Anticlimactic and boring, and absolutely no back story, he just randomly transforms from being far weaker than he was in the Tournament of Power... Again, the animation of the characters was so off it looked like fan art from photoshop.Lastly is the creation of Cell Max. This was one of the worst parts of the movie, being that they claimed he was far superior to the original Cell. But he could not talk, he didn't heal automatically, or regenerate, and he was unrealistically large like a giant. No back story to how they improved him from the original (did they get cells from other aliens that visit the planet like Beerus, or Whis etc?) They should have definitely kept him closer to the original Perfect Cell but more powerful and intelligent and change his appearance slightly. Having Wings was pointless as pretty much everyone can fly with energy.. he could have powered up to fly away instead of using his wings..Great Plot though, had a good story too it. Just incredibly disappointing designs and lack of information."
46,"I'm not a Dragon Ball fan, the only times I've watched it was back in childhood, when DB and DBZ were streamed on TV. So it's needless to say, that I went into it clueless with some very old and general knowledge of the series, thinking it's gonna be a waste of my time. But to my surprise I genuinely enjoyed the movie. It was really fun and lighthearted story, that casual (in this series) like me, would like. I could understand why some fans of the series might hate it as it's just a filler and doesn't really feature main characters that much or add some depth to the story and so on. Does the story have some deeper meaning? No. Does it rely on Dragon Ball on Dragon Ball series' jokes? Yes. But it's the nostalgia and some Dragon Ball well known shticks, that made whole theater burst out laughing several times during the movie. This self-awarness and campiness is what really sold me on it (also Piccolo and his big titties being main protagonist(-s), honestly, I remember liking Piccolo as a kid and this movie brought back that fondness, but in a slightly different way). Didn't mind the 3d animation, just in faster paced action scenes did it bother me a bit with cgi being too visible (if that makes sense). The color palette for the movie was pretty too. Overall an enjoyable, fun and easy watch."
47,"I've seen the movie on cinema, and me laugh so much and like the humor on this movie! It's very well done! The graphics and cgi with a mix of 2D and 3D it's very very nice!This movie showed that they care about other characters besides goku and vegeta! I love they tell much more of the life of other characters and the new ones , I really love that they create new relations on some characters and other ones from past movies.I think it's a movie that is very good too watch with friends and family ! It's a time very well spent.It should be more specific in some things about the story behind and explain better some terms at the end. But in resume and liked very much the movie."
48,"To be honest, at first I was really concerned about the CGI-Animation. Since DBS Broly looked so great with the shintani art style, It was really sad to hear this movie would not get the same treatment.After I saw the movie, I have to say: This is a really great Dragon Ball Movie and I am very happy with it. The animations are really good, the CGI looks really great. The story- althought not being the greatest- made sense and was different. Even though Goku and Vegeta did not play an important role in the movie, It was really fun to see Piccolo and Gohan in the main character role. The fights were amazing, and the movie had a great climax with Beast Gohan beating Cell Max. The only negative point would be the short period of time we saw Beast Gohan. But at the end of the day, It is a movie so the amount of time it has is limited.Overall a great movie."
49,"As A Dragon Ball Fan From India It Was Delight To Watch It In Theatre After So Many Years And As Toriyama's Statements That Gohan Can Be Powerful If He Wanted To, This Time We Saw It. Goku & Vegeta Don't Get Much Time In This Movie It's Properly Based On Piccolo & Gohan. Plot Of Movie Is 100% Dragon Ball Style Action Filled With Situational Comedy But As Run Time Is Less Movie Lacks In Properly Setting The Plot. Also The Animation Style That Dragon Ball Used Is Pretty Unique This Time And It Should Be Given A Chance Watching Such New Animation Style In Theatres Worked For Me But It Varies For Everyone. Overall You Should Watch It For Sure Cause Dragon Ball Has The Best Transformations In Anime And Watching Those Transformations In Theatres Is An Awesome Experience."

71,"This movie was very bad, Dragon ball characters have always been characterized by showing their personality, in this movie the villain doesn't even say a word, he has no personality.Some people who have always been in the story lose their essence, for example Bulma leaves aside the technology for aesthetic things, as well as Pikoro and his change of attitude and tolerance towards the villain.For the creation of a Cell Max should have given more details of its operation, origin, reason for creation and also seems a little out of the story, as Trunks and Crilin finish with the laboratory and destroy everything related to the creation of cell, only take the plans of Android 17 and 18, so it was almost impossible to get all that information.I didn't like it, it's a movie made for 6-9 year old kids who don't need to know the story and laugh at simple jokes."
72,"Like honestly, Akira, you are ruining your legacy. This had so much potential, what is this. Piccolo's big transformation is called Orange piccolo. Like come on man and it's just a worse cell saga. The only reason goku and vegeta were in the movie even for a little while is cuz they're the face of dragon ball super. But they took cell's design and took everything that made him good away from him, and then they had the gall to say that they used Dr. Gero's documents for it. COME ON, HE WASN'T EVEN IN PERFECT FORM. And another thing that made cell great that they took from Cell max is his intelligence. Cell max was said to be complete in the movie he was just beserk the entire time."
73,As title states. Highly disappointed in this and I've tried every single outlet short of Disney plus. If anybody has the link and is capable of sharing it with me that would be great. I just want to watch the movie but I like in Canada and that apparently makes me ineligible to watch the movie. It makes zero sense also that I have to write 600 words just to make this complaint. North America needs to regulate its viewing licenses better and have a proper control over who may and who may not view or purchase content. 1/10 and that's going to stay that way. How absurd is it that this far passed release I still can't watch it in Canada.
74,"This movie is a breathe of fresh air. High stakes, world ending drama that only the master Akira Toriyama can produce. It is a beautifully written & gorgeously animated story that puts Gohan & Piccolo as its centerpieces. Instead of a typical Dragon Ball storyline where the staples of the franchise(Goku & Vegeta) step in and save the day because only they are strong enough to defeat the villain. This movie focuses more on past supporting characters and allows them to shine as the heros. And shine they did! It's wonderful to see Gohan finally gets to show his true potential & power on screen and not just have it be talked about as a potential in the future. They dangled that carrot long enough. Pan's character arc made great strides in this film. It wasn't a lot, but it also wasn't over the top or overbearing. I'm very excited to see how her story progresses under the teachings of Piccolo(like father, like daughter). Trunks and Goten finally becoming teenagers is long over due and was something I was very happy to see. And the newest edition to the franchise, 'Gamma 2.' Gamma 2 is an awesome edition to the Dragon Ball roster. His personality, fighting style & abilities are not overly OP for an android. Hollywood could take a few notes from this movie on how to introduce a new character in a long storied & successful franchise(seriously).This is a fantastic movie. However it is not perfect. It does have its imperfections within the script, but I would like to preface, my gripes are very minimal & I don't think had these changes been implimented. It would not have improved upon the movie very much. The trailers from last summer felt misleading after watching. I'm very pleased with where this movie went and the areas it explored for the Gohan fandom that has been asking for this for 30+ years. However, I wish it could have been a tad more upfront about this instead of using Goku and Vegeta as its main selling point during the marketing campaign for its release. It's great that Gohan finally was able to break through his ceiling and being pushed beyond his limits. What lost me a bit was he shouldn't have been able to do so, given his lack of continuous training. Piccolo made a strong point of emphasis about this early in the film. He was only able to do so because of the hollywood Vin Diesel syndrome. ""Family."" The fact this franchise was built on the backs of Goku & Vegeta, it would have been nice to see them get more than 15 minutes of screen time throughout its runtime. It would have been nice to see what progress they both made in their training with Whis since their fight with Broly. With that being said, I'd like to reiterate that these are very minor gripes, and changing these things would not really improve upon the story.To sumerize, this was a fantastic story that introduced new characters and expanded upon several of the franchises' most beloved characters. I'm very excited to see how Toriyama implements Pan & Gamma 2, the ever expanding universe of Dragon Ball Super."
75,"The entire movie looked like Video game art from Budokai Tenkaichi cut scenes. The art style was completely different than the original Dragon Ball Super series. It was incredibly disappointing and definitely ruined any enjoyment I had watching the movie.Gohans transformation was incredibly Anticlimactic and boring, and absolutely no back story, he just randomly transforms from being far weaker than he was in the Tournament of Power... Again, the animation of the characters was so off it looked like fan art from photoshop.Lastly is the creation of Cell Max. This was one of the worst parts of the movie, being that they claimed he was far superior to the original Cell. But he could not talk, he didn't heal automatically, or regenerate, and he was unrealistically large like a giant. No back story to how they improved him from the original (did they get cells from other aliens that visit the planet like Beerus, or Whis etc?) They should have definitely kept him closer to the original Perfect Cell but more powerful and intelligent and change his appearance slightly. Having Wings was pointless as pretty much everyone can fly with energy.. he could have powered up to fly away instead of using his wings..Great Plot though, had a good story too it. Just incredibly disappointing designs and lack of information."
76,"I'm not a Dragon Ball fan, the only times I've watched it was back in childhood, when DB and DBZ were streamed on TV. So it's needless to say, that I went into it clueless with some very old and general knowledge of the series, thinking it's gonna be a waste of my time. But to my surprise I genuinely enjoyed the movie. It was really fun and lighthearted story, that casual (in this series) like me, would like. I could understand why some fans of the series might hate it as it's just a filler and doesn't really feature main characters that much or add some depth to the story and so on. Does the story have some deeper meaning? No. Does it rely on Dragon Ball on Dragon Ball series' jokes? Yes. But it's the nostalgia and some Dragon Ball well known shticks, that made whole theater burst out laughing several times during the movie. This self-awarness and campiness is what really sold me on it (also Piccolo and his big titties being main protagonist(-s), honestly, I remember liking Piccolo as a kid and this movie brought back that fondness, but in a slightly different way). Didn't mind the 3d animation, just in faster paced action scenes did it bother me a bit with cgi being too visible (if that makes sense). The color palette for the movie was pretty too. Overall an enjoyable, fun and easy watch."
77,"I've seen the movie on cinema, and me laugh so much and like the humor on this movie! It's very well done! The graphics and cgi with a mix of 2D and 3D it's very very nice!This movie showed that they care about other characters besides goku and vegeta! I love they tell much more of the life of other characters and the new ones , I really love that they create new relations on some characters and other ones from past movies.I think it's a movie that is very good too watch with friends and family ! It's a time very well spent.It should be more specific in some things about the story behind and explain better some terms at the end. But in resume and liked very much the movie."
78,"To be honest, at first I was really concerned about the CGI-Animation. Since DBS Broly looked so great with the shintani art style, It was really sad to hear this movie would not get the same treatment.After I saw the movie, I have to say: This is a really great Dragon Ball Movie and I am very happy with it. The animations are really good, the CGI looks really great. The story- althought not being the greatest- made sense and was different. Even though Goku and Vegeta did not play an important role in the movie, It was really fun to see Piccolo and Gohan in the main character role. The fights were amazing, and the movie had a great climax with Beast Gohan beating Cell Max. The only negative point would be the short period of time we saw Beast Gohan. But at the end of the day, It is a movie so the amount of time it has is limited.Overall a great movie."
79,"As A Dragon Ball Fan From India It Was Delight To Watch It In Theatre After So Many Years And As Toriyama's Statements That Gohan Can Be Powerful If He Wanted To, This Time We Saw It. Goku & Vegeta Don't Get Much Time In This Movie It's Properly Based On Piccolo & Gohan. Plot Of Movie Is 100% Dragon Ball Style Action Filled With Situational Comedy But As Run Time Is Less Movie Lacks In Properly Setting The Plot. Also The Animation Style That Dragon Ball Used Is Pretty Unique This Time And It Should Be Given A Chance Watching Such New Animation Style In Theatres Worked For Me But It Varies For Everyone. Overall You Should Watch It For Sure Cause Dragon Ball Has The Best Transformations In Anime And Watching Those Transformations In Theatres Is An Awesome Experience."
80,Horrible storyline with even worse transformation. Nothing is original. They basically gave baby vegeta's look to gohan and turned cell into bio broly.
81,"This is one of the few dragon ball movies that actually have story to follow and not just 10 minutes of text+ 1 hour of punches (which is what most of the people want anyway). It has great visuals even tho i was skeptical because of the cgi, i was gladly wrong.It makes sense that they could have been able to recreate Cell, since RRA were the only ones with the data from Dr Gero and his projects.Also love the fact that we can see how things developt when there's no Goku or Vegeta around to save the day.It has a good amount of fan service (Gohan Blanco), a new form for a fan favorite character (Piccolo), and the enemys have a motivation, (not like you, 90's Broly). Overall a great Dragon Ball movie, probably a top 5."
82,First of all the story is really just a mix of android/cell saga and bio broly movie. Which would have been ok as DB movies never have stories imho. Its more about the villain and cool action.And this is where the problems begin. That cell Monster? Idk I think it sucked. Piccolo is really the mvp of this movie. Spy action. Clever moves. Wishes from shenron. Tacniques he didnt use since classic DB. Its all there and I loved it. His new form im a little torn. I think the fact he finally gets simething is awesome. Well deserved screentime here.Gohan tho? Honestly the movie could have been a 8 or 9 for me if gohan was just completely not in it. Its so annoying he just transforms into something not even very special in the end and blasts the big bad dead. With piccolos move that he never used before. Stupid. Devalued piccolos power up big time and really destroyed the whole movie. At least for me.

84,"A great addition to Super if you're a casual DBZ/S fan, and a must-watch if you're a Piccolo or Gohan fan! Man, did it feel refreshing to see them take the spotlight! Its issues mostly lie with pacing and way too much Red Ribbon backstory clogging up the run time, the worst offender being Toei missing a perfect opportunity to reprise Great Saiyaman, ESPECIALLY when ""superhero"" is its namesake!The comedy was on-point and had me laughing at every other line! Pan was adorable and the Gammas were love at first sight; they stole the second act and had the best fight in the movie. The CG is well-done and and really takes advantage of the cinematography and fighting choreography. I wouldn't put it in my Top 5 DBZ/S movies, but it has a place in my Top 10 for a DBZ/S marathon."
85,Been a loyal fan of the dragon ball franchise for 25+ years and this film really reinforced what my feelings have been for the last couple years.I enjoyed the Latest Broly film and there was some good parts of dragon ball super but on the whole they have ruined the franchise through making it seems like the audience they are aiming for are very young children? If you compare this latest film with dragon ball Z it really is sad to see how much it has regressed. I was sat in the cinema and it was actually to the point where it was painful it was that bad! No wonder fan made dragon ball anime on YT is getting removed when it is so much better than the rubbish they seem to be producing now!The transformations in this particular film make absolute no sense and the animation imo is shockingly bad.

With that being said, I'd like to reiterate that these are very minor gripes, and changing these things would not really improve upon the story.To sumerize, this was a fantastic story that introduced new characters and expanded upon several of the franchises' most beloved characters. I'm very excited to see how Toriyama implements Pan & Gamma 2, the ever expanding universe of Dragon Ball Super."

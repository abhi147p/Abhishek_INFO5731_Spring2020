0,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free thoughts, please follow my blog to read my full review :)""Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero offers what most fans of the saga come looking for: energetic action, new transformations, and the classic Akira Toriyama humor that works brilliantly in this film.The risk and courage in creating a narrative focused on Gohan, Piccolo, and Pan turn out to be successful due to the more intimate context, but it's still quite far from the epic levels and supreme satisfaction of the last movie.Exaggerated fan service leads to unjustified, absurd new forms. The pacing and balance of the different storylines and relationships lack better control. The fight sequences have good moments, but some abrupt cuts take away some of the dazzle. And finally, 3D animation proves to be a massive decline in almost every aspect compared to the ideal mix used in recent content.It's a pleasant, light, fun adventure but sadly unfulfilling.""Rating: B-",enjoy reading spoilerfree thoughts please follow blog read full review dragon ball super super hero offers fans saga come looking energetic action new transformations classic akira toriyama humor works brilliantly filmthe risk courage creating narrative focused gohan piccolo pan turn successful due intimate context still quite far epic levels supreme satisfaction last movieexaggerated fan service leads unjustified absurd new forms pacing balance different storylines relationships lack better control fight sequences good moments abrupt cuts take away dazzle finally animation proves massive decline almost every aspect compared ideal mix used recent contentits pleasant light fun adventure sadly unfulfillingrating b
1,"Finally a new Dragon Ball movie! The world is waiting for new movies and more Dragon Ball Super episodes for years, seriously!This movie is cool, the 3D choice is ok, but Cell Max just screaming all the time is ridiculous, he is sadly a big fail ...Character development is nice! Delightful to see Son Gohan finally backAnimation looks good, despite the camera spinning around too muchBut this final boss needs improvement, such a waste of potential. Cell is supposed to be elegant, clever, to absorb other characters to become stronger, not just a stupid animal screaming all the time, what went wrong with this??Looking forward more episodes and movies asap.",finally new dragon ball movie world waiting new movies dragon ball super episodes years seriouslythis movie cool choice ok cell max screaming time ridiculous sadly big fail character development nice delightful see son gohan finally backanimation looks good despite camera spinning around muchbut final boss needs improvement waste potential cell supposed elegant clever absorb characters become stronger stupid animal screaming time went wrong thislooking forward episodes movies asap
2,"Giving the fact that you gave more screen time for the Red Ribbon organization just amazes me. Especially for Piccolo and Gohan.I never actually thought that this movie will have a plot and connections to the original tv series. Normally Dragon ball will have comedy and unnecessary subplots.I love the fact that this movie was engaging and the flow was spot on. The fights and manipulation were great in this movie. Seeing Gohan fight was extraordinary well done.The only flaw was Bulma and her usefulness on the Dragon ball felt slightly annoying. However, the fight with Vegeta and Goku, in hand to hand combat made me feel very happy indeed.I was surprised that I saw this movie. I am glad I watched it again.",giving fact gave screen time red ribbon organization amazes especially piccolo gohani never actually thought movie plot connections original tv series normally dragon ball comedy unnecessary subplotsi love fact movie engaging flow spot fights manipulation great movie seeing gohan fight extraordinary well donethe flaw bulma usefulness dragon ball felt slightly annoying however fight vegeta goku hand hand combat made feel happy indeedi surprised saw movie glad watched
3,"GrandmaI wasn't expecting anything, but I loved it.The CGI is something that still doesn't quite convince me, but I think they didn't do it badly. There were scenes with too good visual art, and some amazing battle choreographies and explosions.I liked the story, but everything felt too short, I would have liked to see more and I feel that the best thing was that the main characters were Gohan and Piccoro to give a refreshing touch to the Dragon Ball story in general. The comedy, as always, is very good, the serious moments feel so good, for example the final part.Being honest, I hope they don't use CGI again, I prefer 2D, but I loved the movie enough to watch it more than once.",grandmai wasnt expecting anything loved itthe cgi something still doesnt quite convince think didnt badly scenes good visual art amazing battle choreographies explosionsi liked story everything felt short would liked see feel best thing main characters gohan piccoro give refreshing touch dragon ball story general comedy always good serious moments feel good example final partbeing honest hope dont use cgi prefer loved movie enough watch
4,"Solid film . Great action , likeable characters, and awesome moments . People will always find ways to pick apart anything dragonball related but if you go into this with an open mind and to simply just watch some new dragonball content you'll be extremely satisfied . The new animation is fantastic during fight scenes and the characters hold very true to the anime. You'll see a ton of negative reviews complaining about the new style but after about 5 minutes in to the movie you'll hardly even realise it's CGI it stays that true to the 2D animation stuff. The humour worked well and the action scenes are up there with the best in the series (have no clue why people are complaining about this). I'll admit it's not as good as the Broly movie but is fantastic in its own right . Go Piccolo and Gohan, 2 neglected characters who really show off what they are capable of.",solid film great action likeable characters awesome moments people always find ways pick apart anything dragonball related go open mind simply watch new dragonball content youll extremely satisfied new animation fantastic fight scenes characters hold true anime youll see ton negative reviews complaining new style minutes movie youll hardly even realise cgi stays true animation stuff humour worked well action scenes best series clue people complaining ill admit good broly movie fantastic right go piccolo gohan neglected characters really show capable
5,"If you had told me that Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero would be a good Dragon Ball film, I would have told you that you were spouting nonsense. This film's trailers were not promising at all: the full CG animation, another attempt to bring back the Red Ribbon, and what looks to be a cash-grab given how successful anime films have been recently (e.g. Demon Slayer Mugen Train and Jujutsu Kaisen 0). I was worried about this film and the fate of the upcoming Slam Dunk film. And I am so glad this movie proved me wrong.First and foremost, the animation. Although I liked Dragon Ball Super Broly, I was not the biggest fan of the video-game-like animation in some of the fight scenes in that film. However, Super Hero's CG animation was not distracting at all to me. Sure, it may have taken a couple of minutes to get used to it, but for the most part, I'd say Toei had done a pretty decent job. And if you have seen other CG animes like Beastars or Land of the Lustrous, then this film would not be anything novel to you. But, I'd still like to see a hand-drawn film should Toei decide to make a sequel. 2D animation just hits different.Regarding the story, it was a pretty basic 3-act structure. But then again, no one should walk into a Dragon Ball film expecting any major plot twists or shocking revelations. There are certain nitpicks regarding Piccolo's plan in the second act or how the Red Ribbon is still a powerful organization despite the fact that it's been confirmed to be mostly gone after Goku's heroics in the OG series. You will find it quite enjoyable you don't think too hard about it.The fight scenes were quite solid this time around. The choreography, the lighting, and camera movements were all on point. Honestly, I got chills quite a few times during the third act (or it could just be the AC in the theaters).And lastly, the characters. If you are here expecting some Goku and Vegeta action, you may be disappointed because they were barely in the film. But I, on the other hand, loved it. It's so refreshing to see Gohan and Piccolo get the spotlight again, and the movie sure gave them the much- needed return after being reduced to mostly background characters in the Dragon Ball Super manga. The Androids looked silly in the posters, but fortunately, they were really fun to watch (they almost made me cry towards the end as well). And Pan, what a cutie! She's easily the cutest kid character in Dragon Ball since young Goku himself. More of her, please. Thanks to this film, I hope the next one will turn the attention to the likes of Yamcha and Tienshinhan (especially Yamcha) as well.All in all, if you are a Dragon Ball fan, I think you will have a good time with this film (if you can tolerate the CG animation or don't overthink the plot).P/S: There's an after-credit scene, so stay till the end!",told dragon ball super super hero would good dragon ball film would told spouting nonsense films trailers promising full cg animation another attempt bring back red ribbon looks cashgrab given successful anime films recently eg demon slayer mugen train jujutsu kaisen worried film fate upcoming slam dunk film glad movie proved wrongfirst foremost animation although liked dragon ball super broly biggest fan videogamelike animation fight scenes film however super heros cg animation distracting sure may taken couple minutes get used part id say toei done pretty decent job seen cg animes like beastars land lustrous film would anything novel id still like see handdrawn film toei decide make sequel animation hits differentregarding story pretty basic act structure one walk dragon ball film expecting major plot twists shocking revelations certain nitpicks regarding piccolos plan second act red ribbon still powerful organization despite fact confirmed mostly gone gokus heroics og series find quite enjoyable dont think hard itthe fight scenes quite solid time around choreography lighting camera movements point honestly got chills quite times third act could ac theatersand lastly characters expecting goku vegeta action may disappointed barely film hand loved refreshing see gohan piccolo get spotlight movie sure gave much needed return reduced mostly background characters dragon ball super manga androids looked silly posters fortunately really fun watch almost made cry towards end well pan cutie shes easily cutest kid character dragon ball since young goku please thanks film hope next one turn attention likes yamcha tienshinhan especially yamcha wellall dragon ball fan think good time film tolerate cg animation dont overthink plotps theres aftercredit scene stay till end
6,"The CGI animation is definitely going to be a turnoff for most who liked the far more polished look of the Broly film.Assuming that is not a problem be prepared for a very long and overall dull buildup. There's a lot of talking in the first half of the movie since the bad guys keep flashing back to previous events and plotting their next move.Once that is over they finally create two androids that magically match in power Gohan and Piccolo. Don't ask why, it was already a stretch to have androids with more power than Super Saiyan back in the Android Saga. The Red Ribbon can simply collect data and create androids that are as powerful as the current heroes with no cap. Go figure.The fight between the heroes and the new androids is tensionless since nothing feels like it's at stake. The world doesn't look like it's in danger and even Pan fools around when she gets kidnapped just for motivating her daddy to try harder. The final boss ends up being a buffed up Cell. Don't get too excited, because he's in his second form and completely mindless compared to his predecessor. The battle is eventually won with the heroes getting new transformations (Piccolo turns yellow because of his age and the dragon, Gohan gets longer silver hair for protecting a daughter that was never in any real danger). Then the villains turn allies because it's a show for kids.As for the power houses of the show, Goku and Vegeta spend the whole movie at Beerus' place, training along with Broly. And don't expect something to come out of all that, they are not doing much and they conveniently never find out about what happens on Earth.The movie as a whole looks like it was made to match the Dokan gatcha game. Its gamers will appreciate it far more than plain watchers. The plot is nothing to bother thinking about, the new power ups are lazy, and there's not much to get from it besides an excuse for more units in the gatcha. An overall bellow average movie in a franchise that is way beyond its prime and runs purely on milking nostalgia.",cgi animation definitely going turnoff liked far polished look broly filmassuming problem prepared long overall dull buildup theres lot talking first half movie since bad guys keep flashing back previous events plotting next moveonce finally create two androids magically match power gohan piccolo dont ask already stretch androids power super saiyan back android saga red ribbon simply collect data create androids powerful current heroes cap go figurethe fight heroes new androids tensionless since nothing feels like stake world doesnt look like danger even pan fools around gets kidnapped motivating daddy try harder final boss ends buffed cell dont get excited hes second form completely mindless compared predecessor battle eventually heroes getting new transformations piccolo turns yellow age dragon gohan gets longer silver hair protecting daughter never real danger villains turn allies show kidsas power houses show goku vegeta spend whole movie beerus place training along broly dont expect something come much conveniently never find happens earththe movie whole looks like made match dokan gatcha game gamers appreciate far plain watchers plot nothing bother thinking new power ups lazy theres much get besides excuse units gatcha overall bellow average movie franchise way beyond prime runs purely milking nostalgia

It gives out the greatest vibes especially for Gohan getting his time to shine in the film. It's good to have the Shoop Da Whoop guy back, and perfect heartwarming and funny moments, too.

12,"Surprisingly heart felt story. Gohan, and Piccolo being the main focus of this flick was a great choice, as their dynamic has been lacking for awhile now up until this point. Super throwback to the first season of DBZ. Gohan finally confronts his lack of training, and we get to witness him actually take charge, as he sets out on his mission alone. The 3D animation is a welcomed addition to this franchise. The ending was somewhat abrupt, but tied up nicely with the post credit scene. I understand wanting to give other characters shine besides Goku/Vegeta, however I think they could've utilized them more efficiently within this story. Overall this is a perfect addition to this franchise, and we get oh so closer to the End of Z time period. Seeing teenage Trunks/Goten was the cherry on top for me.",surprisingly heart felt story gohan piccolo main focus flick great choice dynamic lacking awhile point super throwback first season dbz gohan finally confronts lack training get witness actually take charge sets mission alone animation welcomed addition franchise ending somewhat abrupt tied nicely post credit scene understand wanting give characters shine besides gokuvegeta however think couldve utilized efficiently within story overall perfect addition franchise get oh closer end z time period seeing teenage trunksgoten cherry top
13,"I'm fully aware this movie gets a lot of hate, though I can't understand why, it's within their right to have such feeling. Personally, I enjoy watching it. 2D animation will always be a better alternative but this 3D graphics isn't bad either, I have a good time watching the full action scenes which almost doesn't give us any room to breath, the choreography is excellent too. Story-wise nothing special about it, the ending's kinda cliche too, well I mean, Dragon Ball cliche, it wouldn't be a Dragon Ball movie without such ending. The villains somehow are a little bit underwhelming, without so much of a character development, but it's nice to see both Piccolo and Gohan get the spotlight sometimes, so not so bad at all, but not great either.8/10.",im fully aware movie gets lot hate though cant understand within right feeling personally enjoy watching animation always better alternative graphics isnt bad either good time watching full action scenes almost doesnt give us room breath choreography excellent storywise nothing special endings kinda cliche well mean dragon ball cliche wouldnt dragon ball movie without ending villains somehow little bit underwhelming without much character development nice see piccolo gohan get spotlight sometimes bad great either
14,"So to begin with because IMdB seems to be funky as all heck (see not a swear word) I have to preface that even when I put spoilers on I have to say ""there will be spoilers here.""So let's go into it.The latest movie outing for Dragon Ball has a lot going for it, from killer visuals to a decent score, the problem is as is evident from my 5 star that this is a rather badly done story.We begin with a hitherto unknown grandson of Dr Gero who is just as smart and just as skilled with robotics as he was, who stole corpses and reanimated them to work at a convenience store and was arrested and put in prison for 3 months. He's hired by the son of Commander Red (called Magenta) to build new androids to ""help save the world from the evil Capsule Corp and their alien menace""
this is part good and part bad, the good is the manipulation of events seen from the outside as it would look fishy how aliens are around capsule corp and they're the biggest richest and best company in the world.The bad is the need to make connections to prior characters, rather than have the Doctor Hedo be related to Gero, have him be a survivor of East City and have him be obsessed with defeating aliens and villains that way while having his benefactor be a rival for Capsule Corp that we just don't know about who see's an opportunity to control a gullible fool.The base plot is that though, the misunderstanding of Hedo to create cyborgs for the restarted Red Ribbon Army, we get transformations from Gohan and Piccolo including the always demanded Gohan Blanco and now the new ""Orange Piccolo"" for some reason. Goten and Trunks are teenagers now and Goku and Vegeta are off on Beerus Planet fighting (Vegete wins).It culminates in a Form 2 remade Cell going berserk and trying to destroy the world with no gravitas or point, he's just there because Cell is Gohans biggest enemy and we need to keep branding.This isn't a good outing - at all.And I wondered why they did the CGI fest for this, with 3D models rather than drawn characters, well I know now and its purely for the spectacle, there's things done easier in 3D than in hand drawn here that ""look"" good aesthetically but are just the air in the sugared popcorn, it's not got any meaning to it than to go ""wow"" to.And I'd rather have my animated films be less empty ""wow"" and more detailed artistry. It didn't take as much effort to make this as it would have otherwise.So no, not a good one in my book, a fail for Toei and a continuing black eye for the Dragon Ball franchiseNow let's check and see if I've insulted a person or said a swear word and nope...not at all, so it should be allowed, right?

15,"This film was just a disappointment. Let's start with the artwork; I'm not going to bash the overall art style, when you start watching you just get used to it so it's not that bad, but some of the design choices are just awful. Cell looks like a Christmas decoration, Gohan's new powerup design is lame, and Piccolo.. he just makes me want to throw up it's so bad. Story wise, it's not great imo. I never liked the Gohan superhero arc in dbz so I can easily say I was biased from the start, but I just didn't enjoy it.Overall: this coming after dbs Broly is a huge letdown.

21,"Out of the three Dragon Ball movies to come out of the modern era, this is by far the weakest. We have gone from the spectacular animation of DBS Broly to a CGI focused, frankly janky take on Dragon Ball.So many movements just feel awkward and the classic impact from hits is completely gone. Any OG Dragon Ball fan will be disappointed when they compare it with any of the classic scenes and find the weight within combat sorely lacking.Though it must be said , the CGI IS INDEED SUPERIOR to the CGI we saw in previous movies, but it does not even touch the 2D animation peak of DBS Broly. That is not a fault of the technology, plenty of movies like the Kung Fu Panda trilogy and Spiderman have shown us amazing 3D combat in a complex manner.The story is also just a recycled clone of older Dragon Ball arcs with copy cat moments in every step of the way, completely giving away the plot to any fan of the show and progressing in a sad manner with uninspired transformation with 0 creativity. THE BEST part of the movie is simply the growth of Trunks and Goten in terms of design and that is it.I will not be buying this movie in physical form, 1 showing at the Cinema was enough torture for me.",three dragon ball movies come modern era far weakest gone spectacular animation dbs broly cgi focused frankly janky take dragon ballso many movements feel awkward classic impact hits completely gone og dragon ball fan disappointed compare classic scenes find weight within combat sorely lackingthough must said cgi indeed superior cgi saw previous movies even touch animation peak dbs broly fault technology plenty movies like kung fu panda trilogy spiderman shown us amazing combat complex mannerthe story also recycled clone older dragon ball arcs copy cat moments every step way completely giving away plot fan show progressing sad manner uninspired transformation creativity best part movie simply growth trunks goten terms design iti buying movie physical form showing cinema enough torture

The fight scenes were clear and you could follow everything that was happening which is something you don't normally see in the Dragon Ball franchise. The film made me laugh me throughout and not just because of the call backs or fan service. It was genuinely funny. The music elevated the scenes instead of just having some ""hype"" tracks randomly play. It felt like I was just watching a fun action comedy film.I think this really may be the best Dragon Ball movie for me.

23,"I mean, I just don't know where to start. I think the saddest part is that I no longer can trust the youTubers like Geekdom to give honest reviews about Dragonball anymore. It's clear they have to review favorably or they'll lose their access.The story is just abysmal, flat out abysmal. How do we not just have fans writing and producing these movies? With this budget they would make an actual Dragonball movie and not something that would come on PBS in the mornings.I apologize, I'm just so disappointed, they just proved that there is NO WAY Dragonball can move forward without Goku and Vegeta. The 5 minutes they were in this movie were the most entertaining of the film. I hope we can get back to the level of Dragonball Super: Broly or else getting another anime adaptation is going to be hard.",mean dont know start think saddest part longer trust youtubers like geekdom give honest reviews dragonball anymore clear review favorably theyll lose accessthe story abysmal flat abysmal fans writing producing movies budget would make actual dragonball movie something would come pbs morningsi apologize im disappointed proved way dragonball move forward without goku vegeta minutes movie entertaining film hope get back level dragonball super broly else getting another anime adaptation going hard
24,"The previous Dragon Ball Super movie, Broly, was enjoyable with amazing animation, but I thought it was missing something in terms of story. Ultimately, I came out of it thinking I may have grown out of Dragon Ball a bit.This movie, which I wasn't expecting much from, proved that thought wrong. It was hilarious, heartfelt, interesting, and filled with fan service.Dragon Ball was getting really stale due to it just being Goku and Vegeta continuously getting stronger while everyone else was left in the background. However, this movie is basically an action-comedy about Piccolo figuring out how to protect Earth without those two around. After nearly the entirety of Super being focused on them, this was a huge surprise.Piccolo going undercover as he tries to get Gohan to unleash his potential again is so much fun to watch. This premise also allows the movie to be a redemption story for Gohan, giving both him and Piccolo new power boosts that most likely put them back on a comparable scale with Goku and Vegeta for future stories.Gohan is super sick here. He has had multiple arcs where he regains his strength, but here he realizes that even though his father is alive nowadays, he still won't always be there to protect Earth. As long as the cycle of Gohan lacking on his training doesn't repeat yet again, I'm really pleased with this arc.Of course, what makes the story possible is the villains who are a pretty cool concept. The Androids are my favorite villains in all of Dragon Ball, so more of the Red Ribbon Army is great. Their secret base was cool and their viewing of the Z-Warriors as evil alien invaders was very entertaining.I thought Dr. Hedo was silly, but Gamma 1 & 2 were way cooler than I thought they would be. Their superhero gags were hilarious.Admittedly I didn't care for Cell Max. He felt like Cell version of Bio Broly which isn't ideal at all. However, he fulfills his purpose in this story. While it may have been less creative and switched the focus, I would've liked to have seen the return of the original Cell.Another thing I love about this movie is that on top of Gohan and Piccolo being the protagonists for once, we actually get a large cast here. This is a big improvement over most of Super.Seeing 18 fighting (though I wish we got more about her reaction to the return of the Red Ribbon Army) was awesome. So was seeing grown-up Goten and Trunks. Pan was super cute and likable. We, of course, also still get to catch up with Goku and co. On Beerus' planet, which was a fun side plot that excited me for what's to come for these characters.There were still some oddly omitted characters like Tien and especially 17. Plus, I'm so sick of Buu falling asleep every single story, but you can't make the cast of a single movie too bloated I guess.Anyway, everyone gets their time to shine in fights, and there are some super unique moves and camera angles. This is due to the pseudo-3D animation giving them a lot of liberty to allow for cool effects and visual depth. However, at times it borderline looks pixelated and like a video game. Still, I wouldn't hold the animation style against the movie too much. It's passable and at some points, I understand why they chose the look.Overall, this is definitely the best Dragon Ball Super movie and one of my favorite Dragon Ball movies ever.
